# 🐾 Paw's Template

Welcome to **Paw's Template** – a responsive multi-section website dedicated to animals!  
This project was created as a **practice project** during my learning journey in the **DEPI Scholarship Program** to apply the front-end skills I've gained.

## 💡 About the Project

This website includes multiple sections that showcase various aspects of animal care and awareness. It is built entirely using:

- **HTML5**

The goal is to demonstrate my understanding of layout structure, semantic HTML, flexible grid/flexbox layouts, and responsive styling.
